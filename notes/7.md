# Design patterns

## Catagories of Design patterns:
- **Creational patterns**: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns**: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns**: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Patterns:
 **Singleton:** lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.\
example usage: shared resources like files and databases.\
example code:
```java
public final class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton(){}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton();
        return instance;
    }
}
```
**Builder:** lets you construct complex objects step by step allowing you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.\
example usage: can be used instead of many constructor overloads or a big complex constructor with many parameters.\
example code:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    private Person(Builder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.age = builder.age;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Builder setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }
        public Builder setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }
        public Person build() {
            return new Person(this);
        }
    }
}

Person p1 = new Person.Builder()
    .setName("Omar")
    .setAge(21)
    .build();
```
**Strategy:** lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.\
example usage: when you have many algorithms that do the same thing but in different ways and switch between them at runtime.\
example code:
```java
public interface SearchStrategy {
    boolean search(int[] array, int target);
}

public class LinearSearch implements SearchStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean search(int[] array, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i] == target) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

public class BinarySearch implements SearchStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean search(int[] array, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = array.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (array[mid] == target) return true;
            if (array[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

public class SearchContext {
    private SearchStrategy strategy;
    public SearchContext(SearchStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    public boolean setStrategy(SearchStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    public boolean search(int[] array, int target) {
        strategy.search(array, target);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static boolean main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int target = 3;
        SearchContext context = new SearchContext(new LinearSearch());
        context.search(array, target);
        context.setStrategy(new BinarySearch());
        context.search(array, target);
    }
}
```
